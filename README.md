# Milestone #1

An e-commerce website is a digital platform that allows businesses to sell products or services online. The development of such a platform involves a combination of frontend, backend, and database technologies to provide users with a seamless shopping experience. Here's the theoretical breakdown of the steps involved in creating an e-commerce website:


### 1.Navigating Folders:
   Navigated through the folders to arrive at the proper place on your computer where you wanted to start creating your project. This action is in regards to putting your work in a certain folder.
### 2.Creating Folders:
 Organized your project into distinct folders, such as one for the backend (server-side) and another for the frontend (user interface). This organizes your project and makes it simple to work on.
### 3.Initializing the Project:
Began the configuration of your project by defining a special file that will keep track of key information about your project, such as its name, version, and the tools it will utilize. This file is akin to a "control center" for your project.
### 4.Setting Up the Frontend:
Set up the frontend (the part of the app that users interact with) using a tool that quickly creates a basic structure for your project. This saves time and avoids starting from scratch.
### 5.Adding Features to the Frontend:
Introduced a library (React Router) to facilitate navigation through your app, such as transitioning between various pages. This is critical to ensure that your app is user-friendly.
### 6.Opening the Project in an Editor:
Opened the project in a text editor (such as VS Code) so that you can now begin working on the actual code and developing your app.
### 7.Initializing Version Control:
Began monitoring changes in your project with a system known as Git. This allows you to store versions of your project so you can revert errors or observe what you've altered over time.
### 8.Linking to GitHub:
Linked your project to a remote repository (an online storage on GitHub) so that you would be able to save your work online and make it accessible to other people if necessary.
